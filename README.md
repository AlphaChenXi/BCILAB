BCILAB
======

MATLAB Toolbox for Brain-Computer Interface Research

This software was written at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, UCSD. This work was funded by the Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-10-2-0022 as well as through NINDS grant 3R01NS047293-06S1.
The design of BCILAB was inspired by a preceding toolbox (the PhyPA toolbox) written in 2006-'09 by C. Kothe with contributions from T. Zander at the Department for Human-Machine Systems, Berlin Institute of Technology.
